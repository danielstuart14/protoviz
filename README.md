# ProtoViz
![Example](./images/example.svg)

This library is an attempt to create a fast and intuitive way of making figures for protocol documentation.

Currently it supports protocols with fixed and variable field sizes, with the option of showing field lengths and positions. It also supports styling, with global and individual coloring.

It uses [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs) for generating the SVG file.

For a pratical use case, check the [examples readme](./examples/README.md).
